## Welcome to the Pax Exam Learning Project

We assume you are familar with the basic principles of OSGi.
Otherwise, here are some interesting links to get to know OSGi any better:

* http://osgi.org
* http://njbartlett.name
* http://www.osgi.org/Planet/HomePage (feed)

Also, we assume you are somewhat used to work with Maven based projects and know how to import them properly into your IDE of choice.

#### Some recommendations

* IntelliJ IDEA, you can import the pom.xml straight into the IDE
* For Eclipse, use the latest M2Eclipse or Sonatypes Maven IDE

This does not mean you can only use Maven, but most sessions are maven based projects, so you should be able to read, execute and modify them.
